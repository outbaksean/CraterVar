The idea of this site is to both practice programming techniques and to put up some content. The final state of this site is unknown, I'm not planning that far ahead. For this site, it's important to publish early and often. Iteration is the name of the game, incremental upgrades and unpolished content will add up. Perfect should not be the enemy of good.
