title: 'Dev Session 3 - Moving to Heroku'
date: '12/17/2020 (WIP)'

- ## Moving to Heroku
- ### Deleting Amazon Content
- ### Transfer Domain to Heroku
- ### Use Node.js Instead of S3 
- ### Next.js
## Previous Todo
- ### Version Control
The code is in git on my local machine only which is bad. I'll put it on github next session.
- ### Stub Content
I still need to do this. It's low priority for now
- ### Brainstorm Next Steps
This will probably be an ongoing thing. Next.js I think was a good choice. From there, who knows.
## Todo
- ### Stub out GAME
- ### Cleanup
This will become an ongoing thing. The next.js code and structure is full of commented out code and inconsistent style. This should be cleaned up hopefully before pushing to github. But! It is still important to publish often, I won't let bad code keep me from publishing.
- ### Secure Site
Figure out how to use Let's Encrypt to change the site to https.
